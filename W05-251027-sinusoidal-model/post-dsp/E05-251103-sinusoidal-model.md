# Sinusoidal model

Introduction?

STFT not ideal
irregularity?
discontinuity?

redundant data - too expanded data
larger matrix

interpretability issues

pg 1
time varying frequencies amplitudes based on phenomenon that generates sound o
now we try to reduce the redundancy
sum of frequencies that vary in time
pg 2
spectrum of sinewave
pg3
expressitivity of 1000 samples: frequency amplitude and phaseoo
3 characteeristics of a sinusoid
pg 4
cant detect fundamental frequency

hear time, if rate of change enough at 30-40hz

check how far values are from starting point: pg peal detection with interpoation

peaks smoother and locations are better
